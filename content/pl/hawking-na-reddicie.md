> The Einstein field equation is incredibly simple. It can be written out this
way:  
  
Gᵦᵧ = 8πTᵦᵧ  
  
That's it. That's all there is to it. It really is that simple. Though
traditionally the indices are written as μ and η instead of β and γ, but I
can't find the subscript-μ and subscript-η keys on this keyboard, and besides
they're just summation indices anyway.

* Grzegorz (2011-01-27 14:20:56): <p>Po polsku poczytać można tylko publikacje
  popularnonaukowe Hawkinga, w dodatku we wszystkich się notorycznie powtarza.
  Niestety, prace naukowe to chyba tylko po angielsku... a to już nie dla
  każdego.</p>
* Remigiusz 'lRem' Modrzejewski (2011-01-27 15:32:36): <p>Generalnie jak ktoś
  chce interesować się nauką znając tylko Polski, to ma przegrane przed
  startem.</p>
* Grzegorz (2011-01-27 15:33:25): <p>lRem: Jasne, ale to się tyczy większości
  języków, nie tylko polskiego ;)</p>
