+++
Inkscape actually is a nice program. Maybe some of the competition (like
Omnigraffle) are nicer. But then again, Inkscape beats them with the fact that
it's free. It also has a lot of useful extensions (like Textext).
Unfortunately, they managed to break the whole Python extension mechanism for
64bit OS X.

The exact error message was always:

> The fantastic lxml wrapper for libxml2 is required by inkex.py and therefore
this extension. Please download and install the latest version from
http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/lxml/, or install it through your package
manager by a command like: sudo apt-get install python-lxml

And of course none of the hints found on Google helped...

Of course the first thing I tried was installing the _lxml_ module. To no
avail. I have multiple Python installations in my system, so I continued with
installing it for every one of them. Still, nothing. Following some hints I
tried fiddling with _libxml2_ and other libraries. No effect.

It turns out, that Inkscape team tried to be nice and Mac style, so they
bundled the extensions by themselves. The problem is: `lxml/etree.so: Mach-O
bundle i386` This would not be that bad, as: `/usr/bin/python: Mach-O
universal binary with 3 architectures /usr/bin/python (for architecture
x86_64): Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64 /usr/bin/python (for architecture
i386): Mach-O executable i386 /usr/bin/python (for architecture ppc7400):
Mach-O executable ppc` Which _should_ be used by a program, that wants a
standard framework. Unfortunately they happily run whatever is first in the
path, ending up with my custom 64bit only interpreter. Which can't load the
32bit only library they provide.

The only remaining quirk is the misleading error message. This is due to the
simple code:

    
    
    
    try:
        from lxml import etree
    except Exception, e:
        sys.exit(_('The fantastic lxml wrapper for libxml2 is required by inkex.py and therefore this extension. Please download and install the latest version from http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/lxml/, or install it through your package manager by a command like: sudo apt-get install python-lxml'))
    

That was created probably way before the decision to include lxml. But since
that it's not valid any more...

Being a good child I added my findings about the problem to the [long time
open Launchpad bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/inkscape/+bug/482993) and
[suggested fixing the error
message](https://bugs.launchpad.net/inkscape/+bug/602041).

Anyhow, the fix is as simple as: `rm -r
/Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/python` This gets rid of all the
broken Inkscape bundled python stuff. In case you don't already have the
modules installed, then run: `easy_install lxml easy_install numpy`

  actually contributing something valuable, but may I just suggest adding "pre {

  Certainly value bookmarking for <br /> revisiting. I surprise how a lot

* Darren (2012-04-19 14:25:28): <p>Hi - I've googled my way on to your blog as
  I'm using Inkscape .48.2 with OSX 10.7.3 and I can't get the extensions to
  work - BUT I have no idea how to actually execute your fix. Could you explain
  please?<br /> many thx</p>
* Remigiusz 'lRem' Modrzejewski (2012-04-19 14:32:40): <p>Wow, they still did
  not fix it? I remember a claim that it's already past in 2011...</p>
  <p>Anyhow, these two commands I suggested are to be executed in command line,
  which you can access by running the Terminal app that is included in your
  system.</p>  <p>The first one can be done in Finder instead. You find the
  Inkscape application and right click -&gt; <em>Show Package Contents</em>. In
  the new Finder window you descend to Contents-&gt;Resources. You find the
  directory called python and remove it. But then you will probably still need
  to install numpy in the command line.</p>
* Darren (2012-04-19 14:47:45): <p>mmmOK - Python directory removed as
  suggested. But installing numpy in the command line comes up with...</p>
  <p>[Errno 13] Permission denied: '/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/test-easy-
  install-6141.write-test'</p>  <p>The installation directory you specified (via
  --install-dir, --prefix, or<br /> the distutils default setting) was:</p>

* Remigiusz 'lRem' Modrzejewski (2012-04-19 14:49:51): <p>Ah, that's easy. Add
  <em>sudo</em> to the beginning of the command. So the whole thing will be:</p>
  <blockquote>   <p>sudo easy<em>install lxml easy</em>install numpy</p>
  </blockquote>  <p>It will ask for your password, to get the permission to
  install the module. Otherwise you could set up local modules path, but that's
  way more complicated.</p>
* Darren (2012-04-19 14:52:51): <p>argghh</p>  <p>sudo : easyinstall : command
  not found</p>
* Remigiusz 'lRem' Modrzejewski (2012-04-19 14:54:30): <p>Sorry, the blog engine
  ate _ signs, as it thought it is part of formatting. Disregard that line, just
  write sudo and then copy the line that was in the post.</p>
* Darren (2012-04-19 14:59:12): <p>well, if it's </p>  <p>sudo</p>  <p>and
  then</p>  <p>easyinstall lxml easyinstall numpy</p>  <p>I'm afraid then I
