Przeżyłem pierwszą dobę na liście studentów na GSoC. W sumie nie mam się czym
chwalić, oznaczało to przerzucenie kilkuset listów i przeczytanie raptem
kilkudziesięciu, dzień jak co dzień. Ale nie da się tu nie zauważyć anioła,
jakim jest [Leslie](http://www.hawthornlandings.org/). Ta miła blondynka
pracuje dla Google i jej odpowiedzialnością jest właśnie kontakt z nami. Jest
to przede wszystkim anioł cierpliwości, ale i rozłożyć na łopatki umie (z
wątku o dowodzie bycia studentem):

> Folks, we are not super sticklerish about this. Just send us something that
proves you are a student. :) Cheers, LH, who will not accept photos of you
drinking beer as proof you are a student
